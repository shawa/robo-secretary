## TSA
Three Strikes: Automate

This is intended to be as pain-free as possible.
It will:
  * Compile a PDF of the week's minutes and mail them out to council-sages
  * Add the minutes to the year-book of minutes and host it on your webspace

## Usage
1. Clone this repo into your account on **cube**
2. Using the template as a template, write up the minutes into `src/YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (`new.sh`)
3. At the end of the meeting, commit and run `make`.
4. Done

6. At the end of the year, grab the minutes book and use it to write up the handbook.
